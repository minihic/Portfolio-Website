                <div class="about-text">    Who am I? I’m Matteo, a student, studying User Experience Design. Ever since I was young, I liked to tinker and create interesting imagery and creations. I’ve channeled that creativity into a number of areas, such as Blender, which is a great outlet for abstract imagery. I also enjoy capturing reality through photography and creating compositions that I find visually fascinating. Through photography, I learned to record video and edit it into short films or promotional films. Working in a team for short films also helped me lead a team in creating large, to-scale Minecraft builds. While dabbling in computers, I also approached the world of 3D printing and modeling through my former high school Maker Space. There I was able to participate in Maker Fairs to contribute to the maker community. All these creations help me develop my visualization and concept skills. Not only that, but I thrive in team environments, and I am able to adapt and learn new skills quickly. I continue to pursue my passion for creating and designing, and I can’t wait to learn more.
