                    Special Mention. You can find our submission <a class="link-text" id="lost-weekend"

                        at the occasion of the Climate Strikes in 2019. This was my first short video that was not
                        scripted. It was a test in journalistic style shooting.

                        <div class="photography-text">This is a photo from the Luxembourgish Philharmonie. I liked the interesting colors and lights. It gives the photo a futuristic look with the architecture of the building.

                        <div class="photography-text">This image was also taken in the same location as the previous. I found the lighting with the diffusion from the leaves really interesting.

                        <div class="photography-text">This photo was taken in Saint Malo, France. The whole image just gives a sense of adventure and I really like how it easily it starts up my imagination.

                        <img class="photography-image" src="images/photography/IMG_3385.JPG" alt="">
                        <div class="photography-text">Taken from the inside of a cave, the contrast between dark and light outside is really interesting. Taken in Bretagne, France.

                        <div class="photography-text">Here is a photo from some of my experimentation in astrophotography. The photo was taken out in a field aways from a lot of light pollution and so many stars are visible. The Mily Way galaxy is also visible.

                        <div class="photography-text">This photo is taken from one of the halls in the Mont Saint Michel Abbey in France. The lighting gives a pretty dark atmosphere.

                        <div class="photography-text">I took this photo because I found the composition of the arch in the middle of the frame was really interesting. The contrast between the blue and white of the arch is really striking too.
